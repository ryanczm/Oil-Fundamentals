# Framework

* Who are the players in this situation?
* What is their objective/goal/situation/perspective?
* What are the technical terms involved?
* What is the data that we need to quantify this event? Augmenting data to support the argument. 
* Why are the players acting in this way? (logic/analysis)

Note, github markdown cannot render color. I bold selected parts of the text, then color in the data or article I need to understand it. Better viewed in vscode or some IDE.

|Contract mechanics| Write an article to understand contract mechanics of refiners buying crude cargoes. Understand end-to-end process. |
|Russian price cap| Write an article to understand mechanics/situation of how the G7 price cuts work and why it failed. |
|US LNG mechanics | Write an article to understand AllThingsLNG's article on how US LNG plants work and why they remain profitable regardless of low spot LNG. |
|TMX | Write an article to understand Big Orrin's view that the TMX project will be a failure + EFR's article. |
