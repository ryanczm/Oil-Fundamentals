1.  Long boring threadðŸ§µ. This is interesting in the FT about changing the way the SPR is being run and develop a similar system for energy transition threads. Letâ€™s talk about the SPR and the what it should look like in the 21st century.
2. Despite being the Worldâ€™s largest oil producer the U.S. has such a paranoia over energy embargoes and what happened in the 1979s that a true discussion can never happen without that paranoia creeping in. But the U.S. really needs to re-think how it uses its SPR.
3. That paranoia is seen with the release from the SPR during 2022. A potential loss of Russian oil and prices spiking to $120+ was not enough for many to release from the SPR. The paranoia is always that something worse will happen later. There is always the worry of the embargo
4. But what needs to be remembered the shortages in the 1970s was not caused by the embargoes it was caused by the energy policies instigated by Richard Nixon. The U.S. has wiped over that and blamed the OPEC embargo.
5. Now there is basically zero chance for an embargo in the U.S. First, U.S. gets its crude from much closer to home and does not rely on Middle Eastern crude anymore. Mexico, Canada, Latin America are where U.S. source their crude from.   
6. Further, the U.S. is now the biggest producer of crude oil in the world. Instead of importing 13mbpd it is producing 13mbpd. The tables have turned. Under the IEAâ€™s SPR requirements of 90 days of net imports the U.S. does not need an SPR
7. However, is a poor way of looking at US Energy security
   - The US remains a net-importer of crude oil. It is a net-exporter of petroleum products 
   - The U.S. imports a quality of crude oil that it does not produce and exports excess of a quality it does.
   - The U.S. is unbalanced
8. The U.S. imports heavy and medium grades and exports light sweet grades.
   - Therefore an SPR needs to contain the quality of imports and not contain the quality it produces.
   - In that regard the Permian shale has become the new SPR.
9. The fact Canada can produce more but cannot get it out of the country except via the U.S. means oil sands can be considered part of the SPR as well. But US has a problem. That SPR is now located badly. It can only service some of the USGC or the export markets.
10. It cannot only serve some refineries in PADD3 because of the Jones act and the lack of pipeline direction. The SPR needs to be relocated to the other PADDs, particularly PADS 1 and 5 which import significant amounts of their crude oil.
11. Refining capacity being  less than demand in the consumption centres of PADD 1 + 5, a products SPR needs to be added. Also PADD2 with importance of Whiting refinery. This is easily done by getting (paying) refiners or storage hubs to hold products. This is what Europe and Asia do.
12. Doing this also prevents degradation as refinery must keep an amount of product in storage but degradation is limited because it gets turned over. Even better would be for the SPR to hold significant quantities in NYH to stop the squeezes caused by playing inventory levels
13. The biggest problem for US going forward is the age of its refineries. Outages will become a bigger and bigger problem and maintenance costs will expand remarkedly. The U.S. has sufficient capacity now but that will not always be the case. It needs to invest in new capacity
14. US has also a problem with its crude oil. Its export growth is starting to slowdown. The reason is that there is now excess light sweet crude in the market and refiners are limited by how much they can run. The overhead system can only run a certain amount of light crude
15. Produce too much and prices will dive because it will be unsold and U.S. inventories will increase. The new refineries being built are being built for medium/heavy crude and light sweet is less demanded by them. Particularly the oil to chemicals plants.
16. So this gets to the idea of fixed price contracts and trying to create a put option to protect oil production. It wonâ€™t work if oil prices fall below the cost of U.S. production, U.S. production will go offline.
17. It means that U.S. government would need to be buying oil at above market price to maintain and protect production. Taxpayers would be funding the oil industry. China does it better. It buys when prices are low and fills the SPR and releases when prices get higher.
18. If prices fall below cost then all producers will be incentivised to sell to the SPR at above cost prices to protect production. SPR would become massively bloated. It would become bloated with crude oil the U.S. system did not need, I.e. light sweet and not medium/heavy.
19. If U.S. export do get to a point where growth levels out and U.S. refineries are maxed out as well on light sweet. What does the U.S. Do with a volume that is not needed? The whole FT opinion piece forgets that oil is not homogeneous.
20. The idea of using the SPR as a tool to manage price (alongside other OECD and China) is a good idea. There is going to be no new embargoes on oil price spikes and disruptions. The whole oil system has changed and is much better managed than 1970s.
21. Early 2000s the U.S. looked at a number scenarios where the SPR would need to be released. They included A strike in Venezuela, embargo by Iran, damage oil facilities in KSA, hurricanes and a change of power in KSA. Everyone bar one has happened and the SPR was not needed.
22. oil system has changed massively. better management inventories, better tracking cargoes, more spot cargoes, less destination restrictions, shale oil etc means commercial  inventories need to hold less. The system has changed and therefore, the use of the SPR has changed also
23. The SPR should be used to stop price spikes and disruptions. It should buy at low prices and sell at high. What it should not be used for is to protect the oil industry when prices are low because in the long run it will cause more problems than it will solve.
24. China already does this, it boosts prices when prices are low but never tries to protect industry with fixed price contracts. SPR should do the same. A well managed SPR takes power away from producers meaning a more balanced price that is good for both producers and consumers
25. Just my two penny worth. Idea is good but how to execute it needs to be considered more. Just buy low and sell high will help keep oil range bound. And range bound prices is good for investment. Everyone can survive a range of $75-$85 and investment will flow.

1. Whoever created this chart has no idea or clue on how SPR works or Days left calculation. It is created on purpose to mislead public and non-energy professionals (even some energy professionals) Why? please see below ðŸ§µ (misleading chart)
2. Firstly one should understand difference between 
   - What is required, 
   - what is consumed
   - How much is produced locally,
   - What is imported or exported
   - What can be withdrawn
   - IEA guideline is 90 days of Net oil import. It is NOT xx days of consumption (iea requirements)
3. Now with 4.4 million b/d as withdrawal capacity how much the US needâ€¦ Tbh @ -1.7 million b/d, currently US is a net exporter of Oil & Petroleum products! (us net export) 
4. Letâ€™s consider only crude Oil, even then US net imports level has come significantly down to 2.5 to 3 million b/d (us net import crude)
5. So where does US imports most of it oil from? Itâ€™s Northern neighbor Canada and itâ€™s only increasing over the yearsâ€¦. In fact Canada export more Crude Oil to the US than rest of all world Crude Oil exports put together to the US (canada import)
6. And how much does US import from the OPEC?  Only about 1.0 ~ 1.5 million b/d. Now imagine even with SPR withdrawal rate of 4.4 million b/d this more than enough (opec imports)
7. US SPR present level: ~350 million bbl. As per IEA: - 90 days of Net Oil imports (not only crude but includes products!) However for argument sake letâ€™s consider only US Crude Net imports! Which is 2.5 to 3 mbpd 350 million bbl / 3 mbpd = 116 days! (spr stocks)
8. So please remember these things! So please do remember these: (combined)
   - Consumption
   - Production
   - Imports
   - Exports
   - Net Imports
   - And Net imports is what one needs to compare their SPR level.  Red line in below graphâ€¦..  PS: Iâ€™ve not even considered commercial stock in above analysis!
