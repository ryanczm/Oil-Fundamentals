# Notes

## Physical Trading Exchanges

* Overview
  * This could be wrong. Just trying to make sense of it.
  * The analogous 'exchanges' or 'orderbooks' in physical trading are Platts eWindow (electronic trading platform) and brokers.
  * My guess is, eWindow is automated orderbook, brokers are 'manual' orderbooks (receive bids/offers via calling each other or something)
  * Platts will take data from eWindow + brokers (PVM, ICAP, Tullet, BGC, Marex etc), then do price assessment.
  * So, Platts + brokers set the 'rules' of the contract.
  * This assessment is the spot price that we see all over the Internet.
  * Physical trading ecosystem: large firms, brokers, PRAs, banks (trade financing and payments).
* Price Assessment
  * In finance, price is just mid of top of either side of the book.
  * In here, price is done carefully via **assessments**, pretty complex. Done manually, once a day (so can be slow!).
* Logistics
  * Quality specs, delivery logistics, scheduling, etc.
  * **Must be precise about the what, when, where, how etc**. Operations.
  * **Whole suite of terminology & processes** to facilitate the operation smoothly. Aka 'networking protocol' but in physical form.
  * Complex with alot of parties involved. Just think about it.
  * Operations wise: ship operators, pipeline operators, terminal operators.
  * Could be wrong, but most of the time seller will get the stuff in the terminal. Buyer will load the stuff from the terminal. Rather than ship-to-ship.
