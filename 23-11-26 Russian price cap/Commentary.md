1. üßµ on the price cap. Let‚Äôs start. The **physical oil market has always been a home for many that do not have a moral compass**. Where money is to be made, they don‚Äôt bend the rules they beak them completely. Think **Rockefeller, Rich**, etc.
2. When you put people like this up against theoretical academics and civil servants that have no experience of the physical oil market there will only be one winner.
3. All these Geniuses celebrated the ‚Äúoil cap working‚Äù when **prices were below the $60** believing that it was the price cap that was doing it.
4. What they failed to understand was that it was **EU sanctions** and **the low price of Brent** that was causing it. The EU sanctions caused a **reconfiguration of most but not all the Russian shipbound exports**.
5. The reason is there is only a **few refineries outside of the EU and US** that can **run Urals due to the problem of Vanadium**. **India, Turkey and China** are those places. So logistics need to be reformulated
6. **Low Brent price was due to the abusen SPR release**. So for much of the **early part of 2023 Russia got below $60 for their crude oil**. Only when **Saudi started giving out lollipops** and wanting to **out short speculators** did **prices rise above the cap**
7. Now **many had warned** that workarounds the price cap would happen. **Payments would be separated** etc. to beat the $60 if it was above. But it was also obvious that you **try to restrict shipping that workarounds such as selling old vessels to Russia** would happen.
8. **Then if insurance would be a threat** then India/China/Russia would provide their own. The west thought because of their dominance of shipping and insurance had the power. This is the oil market. The traders have the power not the government. Now we have the geniuses whining because their price cap has been worked around. Calling for new legislation despite the horse having already bolted and they now try to shut the gate.
9. There are no good solutions left to try and stop Russia getting above the price cap that won‚Äôt force oil prices even higher. **The only one is really to induce Saudi Arabia to pump more**. That is **not going to happen**
10. **Secondary sanctions on Indian and Turkish banks** would have **geopolitical consequences** and a **higher oil price**. **Stopping vessels** in the straits of Bosporous and Denmark may be illegal.
11. The real problem has been politicians listening to people that have no clue about the market. Next time bring in the traders. It will not be perfect as workarounds will happen but it will be far more effective.

# Commentary on EU Oil Embargo and G7 Price Cap Paper 27 March 2024 [(Link)](https://twitter.com/Big_Orrin/status/1772919294159995162)


O: I said this was what was happening from the beginning. The price cap was something people with no experience of the market dream up. What now is helping is the sanctions on boats and the threat of secondary sanctions on banks. All adding to the cost Russia has to pay.

# Why Price Cap Won't Work Reasons 16 Nov 2023 [(Link)](https://twitter.com/Big_Orrin/status/1725069926979772556)

1. Forgetting that the **blocking of the Danish Straits** could be considered an act of war and that **every country that Russian vessels pass by in the Baltic are all NATO**. Here are some simpler reasons why the price cap will not work.
2. The 1st is that **oil is not paid for before it is loaded**. It is typically **paid at least 30 days after it has loaded** therefore, the **ship will be well passed the Danish Straits when the payment comes due** and by then the **Refiner could have told the bank the real price and paid it**
3. The **seller and Buyer can have multiple contracts for the cargo**. 1 which is shown to the Danish authorities that show $59.99 and a **second contract** that pays the rest. **This has been done through time with volume of the cargo split up**. So doing with price should not be a problem
4. **Refiner can pay from 2 separate banking entities**. gets his $59.99 bank certificate from one and pays the rest via a 2nd bank or even via the central bank. **Refiners have done this before if they dont have lines of credit within one bank**. **Typically happens with higher prices**
5. **Refiner pays one of the producers entities $59.99** and **pays the rest to a second producer entity**. this has gone on through time to reduce the tax burden on producers or to reduce OSPs the seller is being charged by a country such as Nigeria.
6. **It can be paid via different countries**. India could pay Russia $59.99 directly and then pay the rest via the UAE in Dirhams (via Rupees). That already happens when there are **multiple parties that own the cargo**. Money is sent to multiple nations. from there it is easily moved.
7. These are just some of the simpler ways that you can **get round the Danish Strait scenario**. **They have been done for years**. There are companies out there that will also have far cleverer methods than this that will continue to see prices way above the price cap.
8. We saw **Russians buying ships** and **India/China/Russia providing insurance which got round price cap**. Russians were lucky because **market price was below price cap for so long they could implement these things**. The low oil price had Price cap advocates thinking price cap worked
9. But It was below **because of the EU sanctions** due to the **relocating of demand** and because of the **low Brent price caused by Biden's SPR release**. Once the **Saudi's voluntary cut came in a pushed prices above the cap**, **Russia/India/China had mostly optimized their logistics system**.
10. Remember, **Danes will only be able to stop EU vessels** to check as are the only ones under price cap restriction. Despite the inconvenience these **EU boats will continue as price they get is too good**. They will have **all the required documents** provided.
11. But idea of trying to reduce price of Russian oil due to this inconvenience is silly. **Refiners will compensate by expecting slightly longer sea journeys**. But that is not a problem. Thing that every economist forgets is that **Russian crude oil is cheap compared to the alternate**.
12. **Refiners will continue to buy it because it is cheap** and improves their margins significantly. It is **why Iran and Venezuela continue to sell their oil as well**. **Urals into China/India/Turkey is very cheap and very profitable compared to Persian Gulf equivalents**
13. Only reducing revenue for Russian oil will either be to **push the price down through increased supply**. That will only occur if **Gulf countries ramp up production and drop OSPs**. Until then Russian crude oil is attractive and will continue to be demanded above the price cap.
14. The only other way to stop it is demand and that  is via the nuclear option -** secondary sanctions on Indian banks**. They would** likely stop Indian refiners buying Russian oil**. **Indian refiners dont buy Iranian oil because of the threat of secondary sanctions on their banks**.
15. That would **leave China as marginal buyer**. It would **kill Russian diffs**. But it would **push Brent prices up**. It would **hurt Russia but would hurt the G7**. Main reason EU refiners do not buy Russian oil is because their **banks wont make the payment under fear of secondary sanctions**
16. **When Trump Killed the JCPOA against Iran**, **European countries offered to continue to pay via the ECB**. But **local banks refused to be involved** because they feared US secondary sanctions. Therefore, **EU refiners just stopped buying Iranian crude even though they were allowed**.
17. As long as **G7 countries want Russian Oil to flow**, it is impossible to enforce a price cap. **This Danish blockade will fail** just as much as the price cap already has. There are too many very clever people that know how to bypass the cap (especially when there is financial gain).
18. No Academic/Civil Servant theory will ever stop the flow of oil. This is the market of Marc Rich. This is the market where **sanctions have not stopped the sale of Iranian or Venezuelan crude oil**. This new "thinking" for the cap will also fail to reduce Russian revenues.

1. O: What a load of rubbish. This guy has not one iota of clue of what he talking about. He has been wrong on the cap since day 1. He does not realise Russia not seen benefit due to programs bought fixed price well in advance of loading and payment made at least 30 days after loading.
2. R: How do you explain that Urals is rising for many months now and Russia‚Äôs current account isn‚Äôt up? You will also note from the chart that the past correlation between price and current account is pretty much contemporaneous. The lags you point to don‚Äôt seem to matter much‚Ä¶
3. O: Because Urals did not pass the $60 cap level until July. 
   1. July cargoes would have been negotiated fixed price in May when prices below the cap
   2. August cargoes would have been negotiated fixed price in June before price went above the cap

# Debunking @AssetSecEcon 03 Sep 2022 [(Link)](https://twitter.com/Big_Orrin/status/1565980817905651712)

1. The tweet thread written by @AsstSecEcon is naive in the extreme. It is beautiful theory but in reality it is completely impractical. A thread to explain why
2. The reason **China/India have taken more Russian oil** is because of the **self-sanctioning of OECD/EU oil companies and trading houses**. Remember** the outcry when Shell bought a steeply discounted cargo at the beginning of March?** Shell were **forced to pass any profits on to charity**
3. **Without the self sacrificing of these countries** it is likely that Indian/Chinese refiners would not have bought more Russian oil **particularly from the Western ports**. **Without self-sacrificing Russia would have received significantly more money for its oil than it currently does**
4. What a price cap does is LEGITIMiZE the purchase of Russian oil. Those **OECD/EU oil companies that sacrificed cheap oil** will see that it is legitimately fine to start buying Russian oil again as long as they don‚Äôt pay more than the price cap.
5. This means that competition for Russian Oil will increase, I.e. the return of the OECD/EU companies plus the new demand from Chinese and Indian companies that did not exist before the war. It means that demand will outstrip supply.
6. In this case **price cheating will happen**. Why would refiners give up cheap oil when the alternative is likely $30 to $40 above the price cap? Why would they not be willing to pay $10 or $20 more than the price cap to still receive what would be cheap oil?
7. After all, if supply outstrips demand, who distributes or rations the oil? The answer of course is Russia, who will sell to the highest bidder. To overcome the **@AsstSecEcon idea of using shipping and insurance is easy**. The price cheating refiner will pay the price cap from‚Ä¶..
8. One bank account and show letter of credit to the the necessary authorities while paying the amount above the price cap via another bank/central bank/escrow account/barter trading, etc. It is not difficult and Oil companies are used to paying via different banks for cargoes
9. **Russia will end up with more money for its oil while also selling more oil**. **The 1mbpd estimated loss in production would be removed while companies would restart buying Russian oil products as well**.
10. As for **inflation. 2 scenarios are likely in play to prevent this**. First, is that **trading houses would start buying much of the Russian crude oil**. History shows they are willing to circumvent rules. Therefore, they would be willing to pay more than price cap and then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
11. Sell **Russian oil on at a premium (making huge profits) to other market participants** (although still at a discount to the alternatives). This would mean **little drop in oil prices for refineries buying it**. Remember the trading houses have very good relations in Russia
12. The second scenario is **OPEC Gulf countries buying cheap Russian crude for their oil refineries**. Russian crude is similar in quality to Gulf grades. It would mean that they could export more of their own crude which would be sold at market prices not at the price cap.
13. This would mean more profit for those countries. But it also means they **could Cut production without making a loss**. Example, if **Saudi Arabia bought 1mbpd of Russian Crude oil with a market cap of $60**. **Saud√≠ could protect $100 oil prices by only exporting 600kbpd to cover cost**. That would be a **400kbpd cut in oil production/exports without losing a dime** and therefore putting a floor under oil prices for the 10mbpd it sells. Saudi has already threatened to cut production to maintain high oil prices
14. What @AsstSecEcon forgets is that Russian oil is only 10% of the market. The other 90% is sold at market price and is not discounted **Therefore, the effect on inflation is going to be little** while it is also likely to see Russia get more money for its oil overall.
15. The oil market has a history of circumventing the rules. Just look at **sanctions on Iran and Venezuela**. They still export crude oil. Therefore there is no history to show the oil industry will adhere to the price cap rules because it won‚Äôt. Especially when the alternative‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
16. Will be significantly more expensive.
