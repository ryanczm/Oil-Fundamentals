1. Short ðŸ§µ Remember Ukrainians are not reducing Russian revenues hugely at moment. More crude oil exported will balance less products. But it is doing medium/long term damage to Russian infrastructure at a time where all skilled workers are working in the military complex
2. 
   - Being done at a time when refineries already under strain because of sanctions (quality of spare parts, catalysts, etc.). 
   - Russia does not have ability to import products in the quantity to replace lost refinery capacity. The Russian system is designed to export not import
3. Ukraine has been restrained against Russian oil and gas until lately
   - Both gas and oil pipelines running through Ukraine carrying Russian hydrocarbons have been untouched
   - Ukraine not used their aquatic drones against tankers (full or empty) unlike success against warships.
4. Attacking or even sinking a much slower and easier tanker target would have affected Russiaâ€™s ability to export from Black Sea. Tankers would have rejected and insurance would have sky rocketed. The reason is likely they did not want to send oil prices skywards and annoy Biden
5. Likely going to keep attacking refineries as affects local Russia the most without harming Bidenâ€™s re-election
   - more Russian crude into the market should make sure prices donâ€™t push too high
   - Gasoil cracks should strengthen as Russia produces twice what Russia needs
6. Russia does not export much gasoline but they already banned its export already for 6 months.
   - 3.5% Fuel oil will see cracks increase and lower availability of Straight Run FO for refinery feedstock. But that loss maybe compensated by Saudi stopping buying Russian FO.
7. But if Trump gets elected then Ukraine is likely to go after the Crude oil infrastructure. Which would push prices higher and annoy Trump. Trump already said it would stop funding Ukraine and force it to negotiate with Russia.
8. The accuracy of these new Ukraine drones means much of Russiaâ€™s crude oil infrastructure is at risk. it is also a problem for Russia because it far more difficult to defend against drone attacks than a refinery.
9. Under threat are
- Russian crude production locations
- Russian pipelines
- Ust:Luga, Primorsk and Novorossiysk loading ports.
- Tankers in the Black and Baltic Seas. Look at problems Houthis have caused. 
- Repaired refineries
- Liquid storage.
10. Pipeline attacks in the winter in remote areas above the permafrost line could have a significant effect in that those wells shuttin because of a pipeline closure may not be able to be reopened.
11. But it is not only Russia that is vulnerable under Trump it is also Kazakhstan. Kazakh CPC blend is also loaded out the Black Sea. Any attacks could see much greater problems to get any crude or product out of the area. Things could get even more interesting.
