Orrin:

1. Where is the biggest problem for oil market this summer. **Octane (not gasoline)**. **Shale is low octane** so **could see Brent/WTI arb widening more as refiners buy higher octane crudes from NS, Med and WAF**. Would also mean **WTI MEH being the pricer of Dated Brent pushing it down vs Dubai**

JunTradeMacro15868:

1. J: But if we have **enough second unit**, naphtha can easily being **transfer into alkylate or reformates**. Especially in **Asia the petrochemical capacity is never an issue**.
2. O: That depends very much on the capacity availability to do it and whether that is available to be resold into the market. **Atlantic basin is seeing a reduction in reformers due to refinery closures**.
3. J: Agree! Just **need more Indian alkylate and turkey reformats**. **Red Sea issue** could **make these marginal octane more expensive**. Let‚Äôs see! I would think **TI will be more supported by naphtha**
4. O: It again will **naphtha be a better crack than gasoline**?
5. J: Not so sure, all these new **refineries will yield too much light end imho**. Hard to tell tbh.


Jules Winnfield:

1. J: Thought it was more **ethane into steam crackers** (so less **co-product of high octane blending streams (BTX)**) and **limited reforming capacity than anything**. **The crude yields aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúoctane driven‚Äù except for light/heavy naphtha but if reforming is tight it doesn‚Äôt matter much**.
2. That is the problem. Remember also the biggest new crude to the market which is shale is very low octane. If that is not able to produce enough and upgrading system is full then whole system will struggle

DrEnergy:

1. E: Is **shale really the culprit** or is it a **lack of reformer capacity**? We are entering the **3rd year in a row with a wider than historic average octane spread**. **All reformer need to run this summer**. Make hay when the sun shines ü§ë
2. It is both. **Shale is low octane and has filled much of the supply growth lately while refinery capacity has fallen**

Oil Bandit:

1. OB: There is **a lot of naphtha out there, specially in Rotterdam tanks**. Some **summer spec are hitting the market already**. **MTBE was a problem last year**, let's see how it goes.
2. T: Lots of **butane for izomerization in US too**
3. O: There maybe **a lot of naphtha and butane available**. But since a lot of **light crude is now processed** a lot of these **products enters the system as well**. It will be down to whether **the refinery system can find space for more production or that is the constraining factor**
4. T: Thanks. Wonder **if (any) pull will come on nap or i-C4 side or on the reformate side**. Refinery econs / capacity just so hard to understand from an outsider
5. O: **Atlantic based refineries have already lightened their crude slate** and are **producing more naphtha because of using shale oil**, **which is high naphtha and low octane**. System already working harder to produce octane.

# Data Needed

* US exports of Shale oil
* Understanding of refinery mechanics
* Brent WTI arb price
