## CER 2021 Review

  * Pipeline infrastructure map
    * Keystone
      * Crude from Hardisty to Midwest, Gulf Coast (East)
    * Enbridge
      * Crude and product from Edmonton to Midwest
    * Trans Mountain
      * Edmonton to Burnaby. Then, some by pipeline into Washington refineries, some by tanker to Asia and down to California.
      * Owned by Crown Corporation (bought from Kinder Morgan)
      * Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby 
  * Exports by destination (PADD)
    * Disposition map 
    * PADD II (60%), PADD III (20%), minorities to PADD I, IV, V.
    * Most go to midwest, then gulf coast. Minorities split between east coast, west coast, rocky mountains.
  * Differential 
    * Chart of differential till '21
    * Relation to pipeline capacity: effective demand is constrained by capacity, if production exceeds capacity, have to store.
  * Export by mode of transport
    *   87% by pipeline, 4.5% by rail, 8% by tanker.
  * Pipeline capacities
    * From 2018 supply review, crude export capacity increases at rate greater than pipeline.
    * In 2018 September, supply exceeded capacity by 202 kb/d or 365 kb/d 
    * Thus, capacity is the demand constraint.
* Production vs Exports (30 Year Review)
  * Some good graphs/data of the export and production growth. Support fact that production is growing much faster.

## Western Canada Select

* Curtailment & Differential
  * In 2018, differential plummeted to 50. Then, government set a curtailment: production limits.
  * This came due to pipeline bottlenecks.
  * Supports argument that capacity is very important to making money.
* Characteristics and Acidity
  * Gravity, sulphur (sort/histogram/percentile with Platts periodic table)
  * Dilbit. Thick. 
  * TAN - retrofit refineries to handle. High TAN. Apparently, it's acidity means only special refineries with specific high TAN processing capabilities can run it.
* Form
  * Crude can get blended or modified (syncrude, dilbit) to for physical characteristics so it can be transported via pipeline.


# TMX Website

* History
  * Built from 1953
  * Expansion project filed in 2013 by Kinder Morgan
  * Acquired by govt in 2018 from Kinder Morgan (buyout).
* Capacity
  * Upgrading capacity of existing pipeline with from 300 k/bl/d to 900 k/bl/d.
  * Upgrading storage terminals in Burnaby.
  * Plan is to ship it out to Asia.
