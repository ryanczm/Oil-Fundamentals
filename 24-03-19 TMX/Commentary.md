Views 

- Short ðŸ§µon what will be the most overhyped flop in the oil market. The answer is the Trans Mountain Pipeline. Canadians think this will have the effect of increasing demand for Canadian crude oil. Putting up the differential and make Canadian producers more profitable.

Acidity 

-	The crude is very heavy has huge amounts of sulphur but worst of all most will have **aTaN of between 1.6 and 2.2**. The problem with **acidity is where it comes out in the refinery**. That **acidity number will increase as the crude is separated**. Because this is very heavy crude, the light crude it is **blended with will not help disperse the acidity**.
-	**Few refineries** can refine that. Refineries that are designed for running this crude are **mainly based in U.S. Gulf Coast to process similarly acidic Maya**. (**Little Maya is exported to countries outside of USGC.**). Acidity will be the **biggest discounting factor** in price because so few other refineries can run it.

Blending

* If they try to **blend it down into a more manageable crude oil using condensate**. It will produce a **barbell crude oil** This will **send what limited condensate Canada has to silly levels**  and make the **crude uncompetitive against similar crude oils**.

Load Size

- Next problem is the load size. The **loadport can only handle Aframax size vessels**. To do **lightering** it must be done at Longbeach in California.  **3 Aframaxs are needed** and even then that wonâ€™t fill a VLCC completely. Freight cost is going to be enormous to go to Asia.
- **For sometime there will be no aframax size boats** there so cost of transit will be large and expensive even before cost of lightering taken into account.

Demand Implications

- It means demand will continue to come from **down south**. All current production will still go south as it is the **highest price producers will get**. **U.S. refiners willing to pay the most** because they are closest and it is Canadian heavy is closest to them.
- **Out of the West Coast prices will have to be very low to cover transit costs, lightering and crude quality**. Therefore, that will be **the marginal barrel**, and that will **drag prices overall down for all the Canadian heavy crude**. Will have the opposite effect than what is hoped
-  It will be especially **slow at the beginning** and take a **huge amount of time to get the boats** in place even offering very low prices. It will then take huge amounts of time to organise it efficiently. It means sales will be really slow from day one.
-  Sending **Afraâ€™s half way round the world is really not an option**. The world wants more heavy crude but **not with the spec that this Canadian crude has**. In effect you are suppling too much and need to discount very significantly to find a home.

## Discussion

Yet Another Ryan

- R: Won't someone in Asia tske advantage of discounts like idk Eneos in Japan or like a Zhenhai refinery in China.  To setup a process to blend/reform might reduce shipping and strategic risks from ME as well & get cheap government financing.
- O: They will take advantage. But the point being is that discounts will have to be very very steep.

Oil Bandit

* B: I run the numbers and mostly agree. China won't take much unless Iranian heavy is completely removed from the market. Most of it will end up in the USWC, is cheaper to ship it there than to pipe it to midwest/USGC. Now, there is a fine balance between WCS and latam crudes.
* O: The problem is the USWC refineries are not capable of running this kind of acidity. It will have to be blended with other heavy crude to be able to run it in the secondary units. Where the acidity congregates in the products is the problem.
* B: What is the spec of this grade? Socal has several refineries that runs midway sunset oil which is very heavy and sour.
* O: The quantity produced of midway sunset means it is blended away with other crude oils. It is likely to be a small percentage of the blend used. Would have to o the same with WCS. So demand will be low. Much lower than USGC refiners.

Stonehouse

- S: Canada reexported almost 200,000 bbl/d of heavy crude from the GC in 2023 with operators capturing positive netbacks so there appears to be an international market.
- O: But again you are trying to add a further 500kbpd into the market to be absorbed. That is barrels that have to find a home. Look at how many refiners actually buy Maya
- S: Not disagreeing with your thesis. Just pointing out there has been some effort to move heavy blends to international markets and refinery tests on different blends. It will be interesting to see how much of what oil goes down TMX.
- O: I know the refineries that have bought it. And they are limited and they will only buy on low differentials. The marginal barrel is the problem. If demand was such for WCS diffs would already be much higher

Crackers

- C: Disagree slightly here. From what Iâ€™ve heard, Asia and Indian buyers are interested because of OPEC cuts. Reliance needs WCS to fill its cokers and canâ€™t fill them right now. What I am saying is you need to price WCS against Dubai and the economics make sense.
- O: Real problem is OSPs and, in theory, Saudi will keep to cut further to keep heavy bbls competitive against WCS in Asia. China + India will likely find a way to make it work.
- O: The point was that TMX may not provide the boost to differentials that people hope for. A 1.6-2.2 TAN with high sulphur runs a huge discount. Add in the lightering costs or Afra costs and the discount overall will have to be severe. Lower than piping it to USGC.
- O: If this was a highly demanded crude oil it would be being bid up. Why? Because it is priced against WTI and not Brent. Adding that arb makes a huge discount to Brent. But re-exporting remains low because refiners donâ€™t see value at current WCS levels.
- C: I agree on the first point. I think itâ€™s a smaller positive that most think, but it should reduce some pressure of ANS diffs. Being exported to the max right now, but thatâ€™s a function of limited egress and USGC refiners needing to run this bbls because of config
- O: I think the problem is the market overestimates the amount of high tan and high sulphur refineries can run. China and India most definitely moving towards more medium crude and away from the light/heavy blend. Europe moving lighter and away from medium.
- O: The reallocation means that as OPeC heavy grades come back on line, the supply demand balance is likely out. Therefore, it will have to discount to find homes. The market has been fortunate to bring more light and medium on.
- C: Yes correct, but today those bbls are offline and offline until July 1st. So thereâ€™s a diff to be paid on both sides of the trade

Tradeoilstocks

- T: So if itâ€™s such an obvious bust, why have differentials decreased, why are producers so excited (I presume most have marketing departments and would have been well aware of these issues) and most importantly, why was the pipeline even built then?
- O: I think they believe that Asia market will take a lot. But one thing that has changed is that the old teapots are taking less crude oil. They could run it. But the newer refineries not designed for such acidic crude oils. China demand growth not necessarily been for this.
- T: Appreciate your viewpoint, and I will be watching carefully to see how this develops. The calls I listened in on recently had C level guys at oil sands coâ€™s very bullish about TMX and accessing new markets for their crude.
- O: They may access it but it is likely at very low diffs. Remember these are the same people that have been pushing reexporting WCS out of the USGC and that is only 200kbpd out of a number of million
- O: WCS is an extreme crude. Low API, huge sulphur and very high TaN. Most refineries wonâ€™t run because cost to build the refinery is too much. It means an extreme crude like this has a limited market. Any new barrels become the marginal barrel and supply might be greater than demand
  
Adam

- A: The WCS differentially decreases on the future curve into TMX commissioningâ€¦
- O: What you are saying is that WCS increases in price? But again that is all dependent on what price out of TMX gets. If it is much lower then WCS will reduce in price.
  A: The future curve showed the spread decreasing big time when TMX comes online

# Sinochem Deal 22 March [(Link)](https://twitter.com/Big_Orrin/status/1770937835035533712)

* R: Bloomberg article link: [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-20/china-s-sinochem-takes-first-oil-cargo-from-canadian-pipeline)
* R: "Chinaâ€™s Sinochem Group has purchased one of the first crude cargoes shipped through a new pipeline in Canada ... [550 kbbl from Suncor] ... in May-June"
* R: Bloomberg reporting that the Sinochem purchase was done at "a discount of close to $5 a barrel to ICE Brent on a delivered basis" Presuming this means delivered basis to China, anyone have a rough estimate for what delivered Brent is fetching in Asia atm?
* O: Cost of delivery is estimated at $10-12 per barrel on an Aframax that pass environmental requirements of loading in Canada. Potentially could be much more expensive if world scale rates strengthen. So ICE Brent -$17 at Vancouver.
* R: I've been seeing shipping costs quoted more in the $6ish/bbl range; anything i can look at re: the $10-12/bbl enviro requirement?
* O: The problem is you can only load 550kb which is much less than a full Afra. Also Afraâ€™s are the most expensive per bbl for vessels. Add that there are few in the northern pacific so it means they would have to relocate without any backhaul options because of the Panama Canal.
* O: Round trip at 12 knots is about 47-49 days. There is two day loading window, 38-40 day round trip and then roughly 7 days of wait to discharge. Then you need to consider losses. Thicker the crude the more barrels lost in discharge. Then add security and fuel. Add also that Canada has strong restrictions on the vessel  age and emissions so that all makes the new more modern boats that much more expensive.
* O: Consider your $6 freight to be correct. Ice Brent Aigust minus $5 is $79. Take shipping away and you have $73 dollars. The Toll on TmX is $62 at Hardisty. WCS is trading at about $66 for same period.  Going down TMX rather than Enbridge is losing producers about $4. Problem for TMX is that toll and freight will always be greater than shipping cost to USGC, just because TmX toll is greater than Enbridge cost.
* H: Can't free market dynamic fix that? If indeed it's too expensive, then don't ship on TMX, till toll come down 4$ and then all if good. If only free markets could play out? Are these toll set in stone and shippers already signed contracts at those rates?
* O: Yes
* B: Am I getting this right. Obv spot rates but. $85 -18 = $73 at Vancouver. WCS Hardisty= 68. I think TMX toll will be ~USD$11?
* O: 85-17is $68 and toll is $11 so $57 at Hardisty. First cargo is likely cheap because it is pipe fill.
* B: Gracias, terrible maths on my part. Funny that TMX commitments could end up with lower realizations
* O: I wrote about it the other day because the tolling is higher than on enbridge and the cost of vlcc from gulf is much less than an Aframax from Vancouver. Add in crude quality looks far worse out of TMX than down to USGC


# Freight Route Analysis Thread 25 March [(Link)](https://twitter.com/Big_Orrin/status/1771862793378992199)

## Thread

* O: From **Hardisty**: TMX toll is more than cost to ship to USGC. Asia: **Shipping Afra from TMX** with 550kb is always more expensive/bbl than shipping 2mb+ on **VLCC from Gulf**. Only balances if **producer sells at a lower price through TMX than to USGC**. USGC buyer has new argument to pay less.

## Discussion

Ed:

* Ed: **For the past 2y Afra freight rates per barrel have been WAY above VLCC rates per barrel**, in almost all cases, so it is an oversimplification to imply that $/bbl is a decisive factor. Afraâ€™s are simply in high demand; fleet utilization is high. With VLCCâ€™s, not so much.
* O: The difference is long haul. Afra is always more expensive per barrel than a VLCC. There has never been a period that an Afra has been cheaper per barrel to ship crude oil than a VLCC. If there was then it would quickly rectify. If it ever was cheaper then cargo sizes sold would be much smaller. Saudi, Iraq, Russia, WAF would all sell cargoes of much smaller size
* Ed: Would certainly make more sense for the seller to have that option, but this is very much a buyerâ€™s market, and will continue to be.
* O: The point is that it is a good option when prices are similar or when demand falls in their other option. But it is not a useful option if you  are forced to sell at lower prices than you can get elsewhere

Joe:

* Joe: TMX starts in Edmonton.  Hardisty barrels have to go to Midcon/USGC.  The Producer decided long ago whether their production goes to Edmt, or Hardisty. WCS is a Hardisty blended barrel.  ZERO WCS will go on TMX. USGC going to have less Cdn heavy delivered in next few months.
* O: It was done like that as both in the same effective location. 2 hours apart in Canada is nothing. Those that have contracts may have decided those that sell spot will make a decision once prices begin to be heard.
* Joe: The producing assets are 100 to 200+ miles north of Edmt/Hardisty. Producers built pipelines into those hubs. IF you chose Hardisty, you export by EPL and Keystone. If you chose Edmt, you added TransMountain to export. There is no pipe that flows Hardisty to Edmt. Agree.
* O: The point was that the cost of transport to Hardisty and Edmonton from producing areas will be very similar. So making a comparison of price of both at Hardisty was to make it simpler to understand. That was my point. To make a fair comparison.
* O: I also wonder if USGC prices increase and TMX slip if demand are not there whether you may see producers pay the fine for not sending their crude down the line and send it south as the difference between the prices is less than the fine.
* GD: The fine as I understand it is the full committed TMX tariff, which is around $10/bbl I think.

CEA:

* C: (Above) is why I think the WCS differential will settle out at closer to US$15/bbl. There will still be wider/narrower periods based on seasonality and unplanned events but US$15/bbl feels appropriate - everyone can make $ at this level (upstream, midstream, downstream, marketers).
* O: Worst thing about TMX it is not something that gives buyers a higher price. It actually gives them a lower one. To improve needs a reduction of the toll in TMX.
* C: 100%. The small heavy oil producers who didn't commit to the pipe benefit the most. I think there will be an opportunity for some entities to buy discounted barrels off TMX if producers don't want to deal with their own marketing/chartering/insurance etc.
* O: Until Canada produces enough to fill TMX, spot barrels should head to USGC as they get a better price in that direction. It should mean an underutilised TMX until production catches up.

Trevor:

* T: What about shipping to US West Coast in non-Jones Act tankers? Can WC refineries run WCS or some blend thereof in place of ANS?
* O: They can but the crude that is being projected to be sold is of a much higher TAN than ECS and that limits how much is able to be consumed

Romeo:
* R: The more appropriate measure is variable cost of committed shippers.The toll is for the most part sunk cost. Its the PLA fee that will drive pipe shipments. Your point on Afras is correct, therefore these TMX barrels should likely end up on the US West coast, and back out Latams
* O: Depends again on the ability to run high TAN crude in the extra quantity that Canadian will sell. Most of latams donâ€™t have that problem
* R: Yeah the complex coking refineries that can process the Tan should be  able to drive a bargain between the two streams

Huston:
* H: Yeah the complex coking refineries that can process the Tan should be  able to drive a bargain between the two streams
first great white hope is a refinery system that is falling in capacity and the second is competing with sanctioned barrels

# Markets for TMX Thread 28 March [(Link)](https://twitter.com/Big_Orrin/status/1773326287630749867)

* Letâ€™s take. Look at the markets for TMX. First China: TMX crude is up against Iranian, Venezuelan even Russian into China. That is the **price** they will compete against in the long term. 
* Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Brazil and many others are on **Long term contracts** that will not be lost.
* It will be **transported on Aframax which means lots of shipping cost compared to other barrels particularly Iran**. And itâ€™s heavy crude oil. **Lightering** appears difficult to achieve
* Other grades like Oman etc **donâ€™t compete** with TMX high TAN crude. 
* India: India already has a **lot of heavy crude sitting on its doorstep**. Would need to be very cheap to attract them. Voyage from USGC by VLCC would be cheaper than anything from TMX.
* USWC - much of the crude TMX is said to push out from Saudi Arabia and Latam is on long term contract. So that push out may not be as big as hoped. Add in that WC is an ageing and shuttering refinery system, demand likely to fall not increase as TMX ramps up.
* WC took 3 cargoes in March totalling 1.74mb. TMX has a capacity of 890kbpd which equates to 51 cargoes per month at 550kb per cargo. it equates to 35-40% of WC refinery capacity. That is massive for such a heavy- high tan crude. Likely way too much
* A Coker does not mean you can run high tan. The acidity does not necessarily come out in the very bottom of the vacuum tower feed. Having an FCC is a Massive problem with high tan crude. Further not all have the neutralisation or salt removal process up stream of CDU.
* Also not all West coast refineries are designed to run this type of crude either. So the WC market may be smaller than the market expects.
* The napthenthic acids in high TAN crudes are destroyed in the coker heater. The problem with high TAN is everything upstream in the crude & vac towers and associated systems must be "metaled up" to 9Cr-1Mo which is 4-5 times more expensive.
* That is not necessarily the case. Napthenic acids can come out at anywhere within the vacuum tower. They can get to the Coker via the hydrocracker or FCC. That is where problems happen particularly in the FCC destroying the catalyst
* Some refineries that can run high tan run hydrocracker only refineries. No FCC as the Tan has less problems for hydrocracker

# Cargo Flow Example 28 March [(Link)](https://twitter.com/Big_Orrin/status/1773113874369135015)


* O: 3 cargoes in a month went to West Coast or 1.74mb. Suddenly that may need to jump to 50 cargoes a month or nearly 28mb of high tan crude oil. That is 35-40% of PADD5 refinery capacity. (By the way having a Coker does not mean you can run high tan crude.)
* A: Is that the volume math of cargoes based on the volume flow of the pipeline? ~50 cargoes a month?
* O: 890kbpd through the pipeline on a 550kb cargo size. I know it It wonâ€™t be anything like that at beginning but remember PADD 5 refineries are more likely to close because of age than most or be turned into biofuel.
* A: That is the capacity. So just looking at it from what needs to be done at capacity. At beginning will be less but the
